            This cookie policy (“Policy”) describes what cookies are and how and they’re being used by the
            mariagrandury.com website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services
            (collectively, “Services”). This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”)
            and this Website operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on
            behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to
            this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not
            have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this
            agreement and may not access and use the Website and Services. You should read this Policy so you can
            understand the types of cookies we use, the information we collect using cookies and how that information is
            used. It also describes the choices available to you regarding accepting or declining the use of cookies.


            <h2 class="font semibold tracking-tight text-2xl mt-6 mb-2">What are cookies?</h2>

            Cookies are small pieces of data stored in text files that are saved on your computer or other devices when
            websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to remember you and your preferences, either for a
            single visit (through a “session cookie”) or for multiple repeat visits (using a “persistent cookie”).

            Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the course of your visit to the Website, and they
            expire when you close the web browser.

            Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences within our Website and remain on your desktop or
            mobile device even after you close your browser or restart your computer. They ensure a consistent and
            efficient experience for you while visiting the Website and Services.

            Cookies may be set by the Website (“first-party cookies”), or by third parties, such as those who serve
            content or provide advertising or analytics services on the Website (“third party cookies”). These third
            parties can recognize you when you visit our website and also when you visit certain other websites.

            <h2 class="font semibold tracking-tight text-2xl mt-6 mb-2">What type of cookies do we use?</h2>

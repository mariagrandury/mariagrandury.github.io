                        AI and Robotics go hand in hand, whether exploring space or enabling

                        having women representation in AI and Robotics is extremely important - both
                        for the progress of the field and to encourage younger generations to join
                        in as well. Join us as our very own Maria Grandury, herself a Machine

                        In recent years, Machine Learning models and architectures have become
                        increasingly complex. This growing complexity makes it more difficult to
                        deliver high quality in terms of model performance, robustness and
                        explainability. The introduction of automated evaluations of the
                        trustworthiness of a model is one solution to guarantee that your clients
                        can rely on your modelâ€™s predictions. This talk will guide you through the
                        different AI quality pillars, their importance and how to evaluate them.

                        Hands-on introduction to the state-of-the-art Hugging Face NLP libraries.
                        Natural Language Processing (NLP) has evolved greatly and become
                        increasingly popular in recent years, especially since the introduction in
                        2017 of the Transformer architecture. Thanks to the open-source Hugging
                        Face libraries, we all have access to cutting-edge NLP models that can be
                        easily used to address a wide range of tasks.

                        The field of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics is challenging
                        and rapidly growing and yet women are under-represented. We are
                        on a mission to change that.
                        Come join us in this event where five of our members will talk
                        about what motivated to enter this field, their experiences,
